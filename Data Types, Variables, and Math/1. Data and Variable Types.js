/* Seven different data types:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
 */

//Variable types:

var myName = "John";
nyName = 8;

//New ways to declare variables in JavaScript://
let ourName = "Joe";
const yourName = "Jack";

/*
Var is used throughout whole program
Let will only be used in the scope where it is declared
Const is a variable that can never change
 */

//Variables are case sensitive
//Use camel case
